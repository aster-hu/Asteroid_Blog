In the past two years, I tried really hard to change my career to data science and make myself more "technical", but it didn't work - it just wasn't for me.

For some context, I don't have any quant background. I graduated from business school and I'm not the type of book-smart person you'd expect from a typical Asian kid, but somehow, I had the delusion that I was. I strongly believed I could do it as long as I work hard.

Back when I was a Senior Analyst, there were two paths in front of me — either to follow the people manager track or stick with the specialist route as an individual contributor. I always thought I would be the latter because I have very little desire to manage people and absolutely hate starting my workday with back-to-back meetings. For me, the obvious option was to become a technical expert, and what else could be better than the field that everybody knows these days? That was an easy decision — or so I thought.

The truth is cruel. The thing is, even though I am a quick learner, there are always things I can't easily understand. Learning programming languages like R was not a problem for me, but data science is not just coding, it's more about statistical modelling and algorithms. Let's face the fact：the last time I looked at math was 10 years ago when I was studying as an undergraduate in China. This meant I had to re-learn not only math concepts (I could barely remember calculus) but also all the terminologies in a different language. It was so frustrating for me to go through the online courses and textbooks, finding myself completely lost in foundational concepts and feeling like a dumbass.

Why was I so obsessed with data science? Well, besides the obvious fact that it is a hot field nowadays, I guess the term "data scientist" itself attracted me a lot. When I was a kid, my dream was to become a scientist. Though I didn't get the chance to study a STEM major, a data scientist is still a scientist, right? When my therapist used the IFS technique to reveal this little secret, I suddenly realized the root cause: I was trying to become someone else — the kind of book-smart person my parents expected me to be. In reality, I quickly lost my focus when studying statistics and almost fell asleep every time. In short, I _thought_ I was interested in data science, but actually, I wasn't. I was just chasing **the imaginary version of myself** shaped by my parents and society, and I believed it so much that I neglected what genuinely made me happy.

Beyond the intellectual challenge, the time commitment also made me pause. Was I really _that_ determined? Was I willing to give up the moments I treasure — knitting, cuddling with my cats, and spending time with my husband — just for hours of math problems? The answer was clearly no. And honestly, I was fortunate that my bank job already offered so much — remote flexibility, decent pay, and a healthy work-life balance.

What's the lesson I learned from the past two years? I was struggling finding "the right path" for my career, and I was so afraid of making the wrong choice. **The truth is, there is no right path**. We can never go back in time and choose again. No matter what choice I make, I must own it and not look back. Walking away from data science felt like giving up at first — a sign of weakness. But I've come to see it as an act of courage, a way of honouring my true self. Finding fulfillment isn't about chasing trends or meeting others' expectations. It's about learning myself and embracing what makes me _me_. Sometimes, you have to take the wrong path to truly understand the right one.
