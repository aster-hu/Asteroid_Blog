Okay, so I did a little something fun today. I decided to ask an AI to tell me what my MBTI is based on what it knows about me. It narrowed it down to a close call between INTJ and ISTJ (I'm INTJ based on the test result).

I can resonate on many aspects of the MBTI result but I never truly believe it. The main reason is the history and reliability of MBTI itself (but that's a different topic). Another reason I'm question is that I never consider myself as a "strategic thinker" or the "big picture" type.

This is where the AI offered a different perspective: instead of seeing myself as a "vision planner" who forecast the future, it suggested I might be more of a "positioning planner". It's less about mapping out a 5-year plan and more about constantly thinking about how to adapt and optimize myself to navigate whatever comes my way. In short, my style is not into rigid goal-setting to come to a predictive outcome, my interest lies in building adaptable, resilient systems and foundations so that I can be better prepared. This really opens my eyes as I used to feel the strategist trait of INTJ seems a bit off on me, but the comments it mentioned makes perfect sense.

I also summarized few takeaways from the conversation:

**Rethinking Progress**: Instead of just asking myself, "Did I finish this project?", I should probably look at progress in terms of "positioning": Did I strengthen my systems today? Did I make an improvement to my setup? This feels like it could really help with that feeling of emptiness I often get after completing a big task because the focus shifts from just finishing to actually becoming better equipped for future situations.

**Breaking Down the Big Stuff**: Long-term planning always feels a bit overwhelming for me, so the AI suggested breaking those big goals into modular steps from a different perspective that associated with either my identity or the systems. For example, instead of saying "I will write X blog posts this month," I could focus on something like "This month, I'll experiment with a new blog post template" or "This quarter, I'll focus on improving my writing style." It's less about a fixed task and more about ongoing development. Along the same lines, instead of just doing goal reviews, I could do "system reviews" â€“ is my blogging system still working well for me? Looking for any "lag" in the system could be a much more helpful way to improve.

**Beware the Perfection Trap**: This one hit home! I definitely have a tendency towards perfectionism. The AI pointed out the danger of "perfection loops" and suggested setting "good enough" thresholds for system improvements. Basically is to know when to stop so I don't get stuck in endless tweaks and actually produce something.

**Life as an Ecosystem, Not a Checklist**: Instead of trying to create a rigid life plan, the AI suggested thinking of life as a series of interconnected systems. For me, that could be things like a career growth system, a writing/creative system, a social connection system, and a health and fitness system. This way, my focus naturally shifts to improving the efficiency and resilience of these systems rather than just ticking off a bunch of boxes and overwhelming myself. I don't need to plan every single outcome; I just need to maintain a good structure to optimize the overall system and prioritize different systems as needed.
