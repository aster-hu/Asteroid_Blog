I'm starting to think about the possibility of having daily logs because there are days when I don't have a ton to write about (like the past month). But I still want to keep writing to keep the momentum going. So, a daily log seems like a great way to keep track of whatever's going on in my life. I don't know how comfortable I would be for publishing such private contents though, so I guess we'll see.

Today, I spent some time customizing Emacs to set up this daily log with `org-capture-template`. It took a bit longer than I expected, but thanks to AI, I finally got it how I wanted. Sometimes I think I might be a little too into automation since, in some cases, the time I save doesnâ€™t really make up for the time I put into setting it all up. Still, it was a fun process, and it's pretty cool to see how Emacs can be customized in so many ways, and I learned few useful argument in \`org-capture-template\` as well.
