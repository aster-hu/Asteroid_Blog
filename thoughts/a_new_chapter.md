And yet another blog.

I know. I have been struggling to update my main blog for a while. It started small, but it has gradually become my professional portfolio as I'm building technical skills and I was happy about it, even though I didn't think of it when I built the website. In many cases, the posts are related to data projects or some interesting research I've done. However, my career plan has shifted and I don't think I will dig as deeply into the weeds as often as I used to.

This doesn't necessarily mean I am abandoning my main blog. I will still write articles about interesting projects that I feel comfortable sharing with the world. In the meantime, this blog is meant to be much more personal, almost like a diary. I have so many thoughts in my mind, and I really need to find a place to dump them into words.

So, here we are, yet another blog of mine. And I really hope I can keep up with writing. It makes me happy and declutters my brain. They might seem as braindump at the time of the writing, but looking back, they might be invaluable for retrospection. Even better, they may help somebody out there, to know that you are not alone and that somebody else is also experiencing the same struggle. Because it is my true self.

Until next time.
