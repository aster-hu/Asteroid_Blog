I chose to draw this scene because it's the most philosophical scene in FFX. People cannot escape from the monstrous Sin so they can only repeat the history - over and over again. Dead and alive, and Yuna was helping bring it to a closure, until another cycle starts.

I absolutely love this scene. It was so sad, yet beautiful.
