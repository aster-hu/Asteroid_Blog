[![Lanyon theme](lanyon.png)](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)


I'm a crazy theme person. After spending sometime searching around, I ended up choosing [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) as my theme.

## Install Theme

The theme is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole) so I followed their [instruction](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage).

If there's any error message when running the server, double check if all dependencies has been installed.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Customize Theme Color

I'm using Cyan color schemes that ship with Lanyon, but I customized the default color into a deeper cyan color `#408F96`.

To change it, go to `/public/css/lanyon.css` and search `cyan`.

Replace the code below:

```css
.theme-base-0c .sidebar,
.theme-base-0c .sidebar-toggle:active,
.theme-base-0c #sidebar-checkbox:checked ~ .sidebar-toggle {
  background-color: #408F96;
}
.theme-base-0c .container a,
.theme-base-0c .sidebar-toggle,
.theme-base-0c .related-posts li a:hover {
  color: #009688;
}
```

I also made some small adjustment, such as changing font size and etc. The biggest change I made is to add a table of content bar on the side. The plugin is [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc)

As of now, I haven't figured it out how to make it hidden when sizing the webpage to small window. I guess I should add some code on the layout css and html file, but the testing did not achieve what I want.

Just discovered that Github pages doesn't support jekyll-toc so I had to disable it from the site.
