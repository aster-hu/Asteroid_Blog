## The Idea of Dice Roller

Actually, lots of [articles](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) mentioned Dice Roller for beginner's python project.
It involves the following functions/statements:

- Random
- Integer
- Print
- While

I chose this as my No.1 project, because I roll dices a lot in Dungeons and Dragons and it could be utilized in other projects that I might develop in the future.

## Run Python on MacOS

Before digging into code, I should mention that Python scripts that involve user input cannot be run directly through code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) as it can only generate output. To run those Python scripts, we need to use Terminal.

```bash
# navigate to working folder
cd /Users/username/Documents/
# run python file test.py
Python3 test.py
```


## Code - Dice Roller
Here is the code for Dice Roller.

```python
#import random module
import random

min = 1
max = 6

reroll = "yes"

#roll dice again?
while reroll =="yes" or reroll == "y":
    print("Rolling the dice...")
    print("The values are....")
    print(random.randint(min, max))

    reroll = input("Roll the dice again? ")
```

I made some changes to accomodate uppercase input.
```python
#original code:
while reroll =="yes" or reroll == "y":

#accomodate both upper and lower case:
while reroll.lower() in ("yes","y"):
```

Note that in the original code, the `while` loop will not run if the user input "Y" or "YES".
The updated version is able to accomodate more scenarios as we extend to case-insensitive cases.

## Function: Random Integer

#### `random.randint(a, b)`

In the Dice Roller, the result is generated by `random.randint`, which is a random function that returns a random integer `a <= N <= b`.
If we want to make a D20 roller –– D&D players should be familiar with it –– we can change `max = 6` to `max = 20`.
<br>

#### `random.randrange(start, stop[, step])`

It's another random function that returns a randomly element, but the result is selected from a `range(start, stop, step)`.

Another equivalent is `choice(range(start, stop, step))`, but doesn’t actually build a range object.

Note the difference with the former one is that it's not an `include` relation. If we would like achieve the same result, the code would be `randrange(a, b+1)`.
