## Why I left Jekyll

- no global search
- not the best workflow for technical writing; code output is a pain

themes
- presentation of blog posts is minimalistic but the title doesn't stand out
- the tag system is not structured the way I want

## Hello, Quarto


- the directory hierachy is different, thus rename files in batch is needed

- fix broken link by creating _redirect
