### Aloha!

I'm a senior analyst working at TD Bank in Toronto, Canada. My job focuses on data oversight and lifecycle management; I write code for my work, but mostly just for fun.

Not a hardcore developer per se as I don't come with the Computer Science background, but I think anyone with the desire to learn can benefit from technology because it's so awesome.

From my perspective, blogging is a systematic way of contemplation and reflection, and I need this reason to push myself to incorporate the learning into my routine, otherwise I would lost track of it. Besides, static websites looks fantastic and, in my opinion, are a much more elegant solution than WordPress.

### Interests

- Efficient data cleaning and manipulation
- Exploratory and descriptive analysis
- Intuitive dashboard design
- Metric/KRI development methodology
- Process workflow improvement
- Tooling efficiency
- Personal productivity

### My toolbox

- R (`tidyverse`)
- Tableau
- VBA/Excel/Power Query
- Python
- HTML/CSS

### Hobbies

- Read wikipedia
- Google random questions
- Knitting
- Dungeons & Dragons, video games

Time management and productivity is a timeless topic.
