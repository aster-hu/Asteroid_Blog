### Aloha!

I work in Data Risk Management as Manager, Data Risk Intelligence & Reporting in the banking industry, where I design Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) methodologies at the enterprise level and also oversee risk measures created by the first-line business partners. While I occasionally write code for work, I mostly code for fun â€” itâ€™s a hobby, so is knitting <br>ËšË–Ö´à»‹ðŸ§¶âœ§ËšðŸª¡.â‹†

Iâ€™m not a hardcore developer by any means; I donâ€™t have a Computer Science background or any formal training in programming. I learned the most through hands-on practice and I firmly believe that anyone with a desire to learn can gain so much from technology â€” itâ€™s truly amazing.

For me, blogging is a way to reflect and organize my thoughts systematically. It helps me stay consistent with learning, which I might otherwise lose track of. Plus, I think static websites are fantasticâ€”they look great and, in my opinion, are a much more elegant solution than WordPress.

Keep calm and stay sharp!
